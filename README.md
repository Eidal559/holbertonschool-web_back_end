## Overview

This repository includes tasks and projects that cover essential back-end development concepts and technologies. The curriculum is designed to gradually build your skills, from understanding basic authentication to working with asynchronous functions and more advanced topics in data manipulation and testing.

## Folder Structure

Each folder focuses on a specific module within back-end development. Hereâ€™s a summary of the main folders:

- **Basic_authentication**: Tasks related to implementing and understanding basic authentication mechanisms.
- **ES6_basic**: Introduces ES6 syntax and fundamental JavaScript concepts.
- **ES6_classes**: Focuses on classes and object-oriented programming in JavaScript.
- **ES6_data_manipulation**: Demonstrates data manipulation techniques in JavaScript using ES6 features.
- **ES6_promise**: Covers the use of promises in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations.
- **NoSQL**: Provides an introduction to NoSQL databases and their applications.
- **Session_authentication**: Tasks related to session-based authentication.
- **Unittests_and_integration_tests**: Covers testing strategies, including unit and integration tests, to ensure code reliability.
- **Caching**: Implements caching strategies for improving application performance.
- **i18n**: Tasks related to internationalization (i18n) to make applications accessible in multiple languages.
- **Pagination**: Techniques for paginating data in APIs or databases to manage large datasets.
- **Personal_data**: Covers handling and securing personal data.
- **Python_async_comprehension**: Focuses on asynchronous comprehension in Python for efficient data processing.
- **Python_async_function**: Introduces asynchronous functions in Python and their applications.
- **Python_variable_annotations**: Covers the use of variable annotations in Python for type hinting.
- **User_authentication_service**: Implements a user authentication service to manage user logins and registrations.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Core programming language for building back-end logic.
- **Python**: Used for asynchronous programming and various back-end tasks.
- **NoSQL**: For data storage in tasks that involve non-relational databases.
- **Authentication Protocols**: Covers different types of authentication, including basic and session-based authentication.
- **Caching Strategies**: Techniques for caching to enhance application performance.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Tools and methods to make applications adaptable to different languages.
- **Testing (Unit and Integration)**: Ensuring code reliability through automated tests.

## Project Story

This project began as part of my journey at Holberton School, where I aimed to deepen my understanding of back-end development. Each module in this repository is designed to tackle a new concept, building upon previous knowledge. I have enjoyed the process of experimenting with new tools, overcoming technical challenges, and gaining a strong foundation in the key aspects of server-side development. This repository not only showcases the tasks completed but also serves as a resource I can refer back to as I continue growing as a developer.

## Implemented Features

- Basic and session-based authentication implementations
- Data manipulation using ES6 features
- Asynchronous programming in both JavaScript and Python
- Unit and integration tests to ensure code quality
- Caching and pagination techniques to improve performance
- Internationalization support (i18n)
- Secure handling of personal data

### To-Do
- Expand the **User_authentication_service** with OAuth support.
- Add advanced caching mechanisms for more complex scenarios.
- Implement additional examples for asynchronous programming with `async`/`await`.

## Challenges Faced

The most challenging aspect of this project was working with asynchronous programming in Python, particularly understanding how `async` functions and comprehensions work. Debugging asynchronous code required a shift in thinking compared to synchronous programming. Additionally, implementing secure authentication mechanisms involved learning about best practices in security and session management, which was both challenging and rewarding.

## Getting Started

To work with this repository, clone it to your local machine and navigate to the specific folders to view tasks or projects.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eidal559/holbertonschool-web_back_end.git
cd holbertonschool-web_back_end
```

Each folder may contain its own README file with task-specific instructions, or you can explore the files to understand the concepts covered.
